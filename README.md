## Why I did this

After `console.log(post)`ing ad nauseum while building a UI component to render Bluesky posts using the [Bluesky API](https://docs.bsky.app/), I decided to build an explorer tool to make it easier for myself. A day later, Bluesky Explorer was born.

For now, searching by Bluesky handles, profile URIs, and DIDs are supported, and all posts from an account are displayed. In the future I'll add better support for threads, and possibly for searching by individual posts, feeds, and other data structures.
### Built with
